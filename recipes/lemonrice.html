    <h2>Lemon Rice, my favourite</h2>
    <p>Sometimes after cooking for Thor and Loki, I end up with having too much left-over Rice and it would be a waste to throw that all away. So I decided to find a way to use that efficiently and the end result? LEMON RICE!</p>

        <li>Lemons</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <li>Wash and soak half a cup of rice in a bowl for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Create tempering by heating half a spoon of oil in a pan</li>
        <li>Roast 4 spoons of peanuts until crunchy and deep golden.</li>
